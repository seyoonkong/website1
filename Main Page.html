    <h2>Seyoon Kong's Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Hello! I am a senior majoring in Information Science, and I am from South Korea. My journey in the United States has now spanned four years, but prior to that, I had lived in Canada for five years. With a total of nine years spent living abroad, I've had the opportunity to immerse myself in diverse cultures and experiences.

Aside from my academic pursuits, I have a deep passion for sports. Whether it's a leisurely round of golf, an intense game of basketball, or the thrill of skiing down snow-covered slopes, you can often find me engaged in these activities during my free time.

One of the primary reasons I decided to join this class is my keen interest in web development. I believe that the ability to create and understand websites is a valuable skill in today's digital age. This course presents an excellent opportunity for me to delve into the intricacies of how websites function, how they are constructed, and how they can be optimized for various purposes. I'm excited to embark on this learning journey and look forward to gaining a deeper understanding of the fascinating world of web development.

<h2>Hongfei Zhang's Introduction</h2>
<p>
    My name is Hongfei Zhang, and I am currently a junior pursuing a double major in computer science and information science. Alongside my technical studies, I have a keen interest in exploring the portrayal of social issues within the realm of the internet, with a particular focus on the nascent field of web3.0. As part of my exploration, I actively engage with my Oculus Quest 2 VR device, utilizing it for gaming and social interactions. During these immersive experiences, I frequently find myself pondering the various ways in which social issues manifest and interact within virtual platforms.

In my leisure time, I have a passion for both badminton and swimming, which serve as a refreshing escape from the world of technology and allow me to maintain a well-rounded and balanced lifestyle.
